  <h3 class="subheading">What is unweighted GPA and how is it calculated?</h3>
  <p class="text2">Unweighted GPA is your Grade Point average solely based on the grades your receive in your classes.
    Each letter grade has a numerical value relating to it. The values for each grade are added up and divided by the
    total number of classes, forming your unweighted GPA.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">What is weighted GPA and how is it calculated?</h3>
  <p class="text2">Your Weighted GPA takes into account the level of the classes you are taking. AP and Honors Classes
    boost your weighted GPA. It is calculated by taking the unweighted GPA, multiplying it by the number of classes,
    adding 1.0 for each AP or Honors course taken, and dividing that total by the class count.</p>

  <h2 class="subheading">How to use the GPA Calculator</h2>
  <p class="text2">Enter the grade for your class in the "Enter Grade" Drop-Down Menu. Then, enter the class type in the
    "Enter your class type" drop-down. For example, if you are taking an AP Class, you will choose "AP". CLick the
    button "Enter Next Grade" and enter the grade and class type for your next class. When you are done entering for all
    your classes, click the "Calculate" button to get the Weighted and Unweighted GPA. If at any point you want to
    restart, whether you made a mistake or want to calculate GPA again, click "Restart Calculations".</p>
